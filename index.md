I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 1
Very simple, basically just a setup for all labs in general. Everyone needs to at least start from the basic before learning to code, no matter what code language it is

* Lab 6
I enjoyed creating strings with my partner. The lab was way more easier than I thought it would be when I first came in. Turns out me and my partner were able to get things done on time. You are able to create things on its own through strings

* Lab 9
Simply just easy and the code was just understandable. Very quick and simple to code. All we needed to do was to extract data from a soruce and put it into our code. Surprising, part 1 was similar to part 2.
